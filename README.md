ALIEN INVASION GAME:

Alien Invasion Game is a fun 2D space shooter game built using Python and Pygame.
The player controls a spaceship and must destroy incoming aliens while avoiding collisions.
This project demonstrates game logic, object-oriented programming, collision detection, sound effects, scoring system, and smooth gameplay mechanics.

GAME OVERVIEW:

In this game:
You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen.
Aliens continuously invade from the top.
You must shoot them before they reach you.
The game gets harder as the level increases.
Score increases for every alien destroyed.
This project is great for understanding game development concepts using Python.

FEATURES: 

Smooth spaceship movement.
Bullet firing system.
Alien fleet movement.
Collision detection.
Score tracking.
Level progression (difficulty increases).
Sound effects.
Game Over system.

TECHNOIOGIES USED:
Python 3, Pygame library.

HOW TO RUN THE GAME:
Step 1: Install Python
Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Step 2: Install Pygame
Open terminal / command prompt and run:
pip install pygame

Step 3: Run the Game
