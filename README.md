# Alien-Invansion-Game

Alien Invasion Game:
Alien Invasion Game is a fun 2D space shooter game built using Python and Pygame.
The player controls a spaceship and must destroy incoming aliens while avoiding collisions.
This project demonstrates game logic, object-oriented programming, collision detection, sound effects, scoring system, and smooth gameplay mechanics.

Game Overview:
In this game:
You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen
Aliens continuously invade from the top
You must shoot them before they reach you
The game gets harder as the level increases
Score increases for every alien destroyed
This project is great for understanding game development concepts using Python.

Features: 
Smooth spaceship movement
Bullet firing system
Alien fleet movement
Collision detection
Score tracking
Level progression (difficulty increases)
Sound effects
Game Over system

Technologies Used:
Python 3
Pygame librar

How to Run the Game:
Step 1: Install Python
Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
Step 2: Install Pygame
Open terminal / command prompt and run:
Copy code
pip install pygame
Step 3: Run the Game
Go to the project folder and run:
Copy code
